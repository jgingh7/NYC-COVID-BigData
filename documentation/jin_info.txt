Project description:
I have chosen to focus on the impact of COVID-19 to crime in NYC, especially hate-crime.
I may be using population growth and total crime rate change to get a more deeper understanding
of how COVID-19 had impacted hate-crime.

List of datasets:
1. Name: COVID-19 Outcomes by Testing Cohorts: Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths

   Description: The dataset shows outcomes (confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) for cohorts defined by each date of specimen collection (specimen_date).

Data Cleaning and Integration:
- NYPD_Hate_Crimes:
  It had rows with same "Full Complaint ID" and "Arrest Id". I presume as below:
  	no ArrestID -> no arrest
	same FCID, different ArrestID -> different arrests for different people in same crime incidient
	different FCID, same ArrestID -> 2 complaint calls for the same incident
  However, this information was not needed for me at the moment, so I decided to delete duplicate rows.
  I tried using OpenRefine to cleanse the data, but for some reason, dealing with duplicates did not work.
  I implemented data cleansing code in Juypter instead.
- (non)seven-major-felony-offenses-by-precinct-2000-2020: The two data had already been set as a table,
       so it was hard to code to get the numbers I need. I used excel sum to get the numbers I needed.
